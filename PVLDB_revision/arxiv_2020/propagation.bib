This is an important problem with many applications, including that of computing driving directions. We allow preprocessing the graph using a linear amount of extra space to store auxiliary information, and using this information to answer shortest path queries quickly. Our approach uses A search in combination with a new graph-theoretic lower-bounding technique based on landmarks and the triangle inequality. We also develop new bidirectional variants of A search and investigate several variants of the new algorithms to nd those that are most ecient in practice. Our algorithms compute optimal shortest paths and work on any directed graph. We give experimental results showing that the most ecient of our new algorithms outperforms previous algorithms, in particular A search with Euclidean bounds, by a wide margin on road networks. We also experiment with several synthetic graph families.},

@article{Watts1998Collective,
    abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

@article{Abraham2005Metric,
    abstract = {We consider the problem of embedding finite metrics with slack: we seek to produce embeddings with small dimension and distortion while allowing a (small) constant fraction of all distances to be arbitrarily distorted. This definition is motivated by recent research in the networking community, which achieved striking empirical success at embedding Internet latencies with low distortion into low-dimensional Euclidean space, provided that some small slack is allowed. Answering an open question of Kleinberg, Slivkins, and Wexler [29], we show that provable guarantees of this type can in fact be achieved in general: any finite metric can be embedded, with constant slack and constant distortion, into constant-dimensional Euclidean space. We then show that there exist stronger embeddings into \ell 1 which exhibit gracefully degrading distortion: these is a single embedding into \ell 1 that achieves distortion at most O(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon }) on all  but at most an \varepsilon fraction of distances, simultaneously for all \varepsilon \&gt; 0. We extend this with distortion O(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon })  to maps into general \ell p, p  \ge 1 for several classes of metrics, including those with bounded doubling dimension and those arising from the shortest-path metric of a graph with an excluded minor. Finally, we show that many of our constructions are tight, and give a general technique to obtain lower bounds for \varepsilon-slack embeddings from lower bounds for low-distortion embeddings.},

It is computationally-expensive to exactly determine betweenness; currently the fastest-known algorithm by Brandes requires O(nm) time for unweighted graphs and O(nm + n 2logn) time for weighted graphs, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the network. These are also the worst-case time bounds for computing the betweenness score of a single vertex. In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of a given vertex, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our approximation algorithm is based on an adaptive sampling technique that significantly reduces the number of single-source shortest path computations for vertices with high centrality. We conduct an extensive experimental study on real-world graph instances, and observe that our random sampling algorithm gives very good betweenness approximations for biological networks, road networks and web crawls.},

@inproceedings{Inan2008Hybrid,

Therefore matching and linking records corresponding to the same real-world entity distributed across these data sets is a challenging task. If the data sets contain private information, the problem becomes even harder due to privacy concerns. Existing solutions of this problem mostly follow two approaches: sanitization techniques and cryptographic techniques. The former achieves privacy by perturbing sensitive data at the expense of degrading matching accuracy. The later, on the other hand, attains both privacy and high accuracy under heavy communication and computation costs. In this paper, we propose a method that combines these two approaches and enables users to trade off between privacy, accuracy and cost. Experiments conducted on real data sets show that our method has significantly lower costs than cryptographic techniques and yields much more accurate matching results compared to sanitization techniques, even when the data sets are perturbed extensively.},

We formalize the typical social network interface and the information about links that it provides to its users in terms of lookahead. We consider a particular threat in which an attacker subverts user accounts to gain information about local neighborhoods in the network and pieces them together in order to build a global picture. We analyze, both experimentally and theoretically, the number of user accounts an attacker would need to subvert for a successful attack, as a function of his strategy for choosing users whose accounts to subvert and a function of the lookahead provided by the network. We conclude that such an attack is feasible in practice, and thus any social network that wishes to protect the link privacy of its users should take great care in choosing the lookahead of its interface, limiting it to 1 or 2, whenever possible.},

@inproceedings{Shrivastava2008Mining,
    abstract = {Modern communication networks are vulnerable to attackers who send unsolicited messages to innocent users, wasting network resources and user time. Some examples of such attacks are spam emails, annoying tele-marketing phone calls, viral marketing in social networks, etc. Existing techniques to identify these attacks are tailored to certain specific domains (like email spam filtering), but are not applicable to a majority of other networks. We provide a generic abstraction of such attacks, called the Random Link Attack (RLA), that can be used to describe a large class of attacks in communication networks. In an RLA, the malicious user creates a set of false identities and uses them to communicate with a large, random set of innocent users. We mine the social networking graph extracted from user interactions in the communication network to find RLAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to conceptualize the attack definition, applicable to a variety of communication networks. In this paper, we formally define RLA and show that the problem of finding an RLA is NP-complete. We also provide two efficient heuristics to mine subgraphs satisfying the RLA property; the first (GREEDY) is based on greedy set-expansion, and the second (TRWALK) on randomized graph traversal. Our experiments with a real-life data set demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.},

@inproceedings{Zhou2008Preserving,

With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on privacy preservation can deal with relational data only, and cannot be applied to social network data. In this paper, we take an initiative towards preserving privacy in social network data. We identify an essential type of privacy attacks: neighborhood attacks. If an adversary has some knowledge about the neighbors of a target victim and the relationship among the neighbors, the victim may be re-identified from a social network even if the victim's identity is preserved using the conventional anonymization techniques. We show that the problem is challenging, and present a practical solution to battle neighborhood attacks. The empirical study indicates that anonymized social networks generated by our method can still be used to answer aggregate network queries with high accuracy.},
